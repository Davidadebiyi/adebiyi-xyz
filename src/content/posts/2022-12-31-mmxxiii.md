Ship every Friday.

Do not drink cheap whiskey or wine ever again.

No go die for people wey no fit die for you. If they are indifferent, be indifferent.

If you're unsure, it's wrong for you. Cut your losses. 

Travel the world, new horizons are meant to be explored.

The mind is connected to the body. Treat both as a temple. Do not desecrate either.

Stay foolish, stay wide-eyed. Never lose that *joie de vivre*.

Do not settle. Do not be a mediocre. Ship every Friday.
