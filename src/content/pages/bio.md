Creating is the most human behaviour. We are here to create.

I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer. These days, I play in that space between Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. I have led hardware engineering teams in companies building the digital infrastructure for utilities (electricity and gas retail) in Nigeria.

Currently building [PowerLabs](http://www.powerlabstech.com). In my spare time, I help organize the local TinyML community in Nigeria.
