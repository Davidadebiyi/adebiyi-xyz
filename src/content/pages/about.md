Creating is the most human behaviour. We are here to create.

I'm a Hardware/Embedded Systems Engineer. These days, I play in that space between Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. I have led hardware engineering team in companies building the digital infrastructure for utilities (electricity and gas retail) in Nigeria.

Currently building hankali labs, an AI startup that creates edge computing solutions for the real economy. In my spare time, I help organize the local TinyML community.
